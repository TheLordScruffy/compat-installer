# Compat Title Installer

Install a channel to the vWii Menu from Wii U Mode. In its current state, it
simply installs the Homebrew Channel.

## Building

You need devkitPPC, devkitARM and WUT installed, and the environment variables set
correctly. You will need the following libraries:

* [libmocha](https://github.com/wiiu-env/libmocha)

If everything is installed, run 'make release' and the output will be available as
'compat_installer-HBL.zip' and 'compat_installer-Aroma.zip'.
